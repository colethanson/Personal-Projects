  <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To make the creamy chicken breast recipe: Thoroughly season chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon oregano on both sides.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter with a bit of oil from the sun-dried tomatoes over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook for about 4 minutes on each side until browned. Once done and no longer pink, transfer grilled chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
      <li>If you are using noodles, boil them until they reach your preferred consistency.</li>
      <li>To make the creamy spinach parmesan sauce, add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the same pan. Cook onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, and sun-dried tomatoes. Slowly add chicken broth, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese and mix to combine until smooth while simmering for 2-3 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Add spinach to the mixture and continue cooking until wilted. Add the chicken breasts back to the pan and reheat for 2-3 minutes. Serve the creamy chicken with spinach and parmesan sauce immediately, place on top of your bed of noodles and garnished with fresh chopped parsley. Enjoy!</li>
