        <input type="radio" value="value1" name="group2">Thin Their Ranks</input>
          <p>If you select this objective, keep a tally of kill points; each time an enemy model is destroyed, add 1 to this tally (add 10 to this tally instead if the model that was destroyed had a Wounds characteristic of 10 or more). A model can, if it is resurrected for any reason (i.e. it was destroyed and subsequently returned to the battlefield), potentially add several points to this tally (assuming it is resurrected and subsequently destroyed several times over). At the end of the battle, divide your kill points tally by 10 and round down - the result is the number of victory points you score.</p>
        <input type="radio" value="value2" name="group2">Attrition</input>
          <p>Score 4 victory points at the end of the battle round if more enemy units than friendly units were destroyed this battle round.</p>
        <input type="radio" value="value3" name="group2">While We Stand, We Fight</input>
          <p>If you select this objective, then before the battle you must identify which three units from your army (excluding models with the Fortifications Battlefield Role) have the highest points value, and make a note of them on your army roster (if two or more units are tied, you can choose between them). If your army has three or fewer units, then you instead identify all the units in your army. A unit’s points cost includes the points of all weapons and wargear it is equipped with. You score 5 VPs for each of these units that are on the battlefield at the end of the battle. If a unit splits into several smaller units during the battle, all of those separate units must be destroyed for the original unit to count as being destroyed for the purposes of this secondary objective.</p>
        <input type="radio" value="value4" name="group2">First Strike</input>
        <p>Score 5 victory points at the end of the battle if any enemy units were destroyed in the first battle round, and score an additional 3 victory points if more enemy units than friendly units were destroyed in the first battle round.</p>

        <p>Score 2 victory points at the end of your turn if you have one or more units from your army wholly within three different table quarters, and those units are all more than 6" from the centre of the battlefield. Score 3 victory points instead if you have one or more units from your army wholly within each table quarter, and those units are all more than 6" from the centre of the battlefield.</p>
      <input type="radio" value="value2" name="group3">Linebreaker</input>
        <p>Score 4 victory points at the end of your turn if two or more units from your army (excluding AIRCRAFT) are wholly within your opponent's deployment zone.</p>
      <input type="radio" value="value3" name="group3">Domination</input>

      <input type="radio" value="value1" name="group4">Investigate Sites</input>
        <p>Score 3 victory points each time a unit from your army successfully completes the following action:
          Investigate Site (Action): One INFANTRY unit (excluding CHARACTERS) from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase if it is within 6" of the center of the battlefield and no enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT) are within 6" of the center of the battlefield. The Action is completed at the end of your turn.</p>
      <input type="radio" value="value2" name="group4">Repair Teleport Homer</input>
        <p>Score 5 victory points each time a unit from your army successfully completes the following action:
          Repair Teleport Homer (Action): One INFANTRY unit from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase if it is wholly within your opponent's deployment zone. The Action is completed at the end of your next Command phase provided the unit attempting it is still wholly within your opponent's deployment zone.</p>
      <input type="radio" value="value3" name="group4">Raise Banners High</input>
        <p>If you select this objective, then units in your army can perform the following action:
          Raise Banners (Action): One or more INFANTRY units from your army can start to perform this action at the end of your Movement phase. Each unit from your army that starts to perform this action must be in range of a different objective marker that does not have one of your banners raised upon it (see below). A unit cannot start this action while there are any enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT) in range of the same objective marker. The Action is completed at the end of your turn. If this Action is successfully completed, that objective marker is said to have one of your army’s banners raised on it (the banner is ‘removed’ if your opponent controls the objective marker at the start of any phase). You score 1 victory point at the end of each of your Command phases, and 1 victory point at the end of the battle, for each objective marker on the battlefield that has one of your banners raised upon it.</p>
