    <p>If you select this objective, keep a tally of kill points; each time an enemy model is destroyed, add 1 to this tally (add 10 to this tally instead if the model that was destroyed had a Wounds characteristic of 10 or more). A model can, if it is resurrected for any reason (i.e. it was destroyed and subsequently returned to the battlefield), potentially add several points to this tally (assuming it is resurrected and subsequently destroyed several times over). At the end of the battle, divide your kill points tally by 10 and round down - the result is the number of victory points you score.</p>

    <p>If you select this objective, then before the battle you must identify which three units from your army (excluding models with the Fortifications Battlefield Role) have the highest points value, and make a note of them on your army roster (if two or more units are tied, you can choose between them). If your army has three or fewer units, then you instead identify all the units in your army. A unit’s points cost includes the points of all weapons and wargear it is equipped with. You score 5 VPs for each of these units that are on the battlefield at the end of the battle. If a unit splits into several smaller units during the battle, all of those separate units must be destroyed for the original unit to count as being destroyed for the purposes of this secondary objective.</p>
