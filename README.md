<h1>VP Tracker</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is my first project and an attempt at making a selector for secondary objectives for the tabletop game Warhammer 40k. My goal for 
this project is to make something capable of not only having the user select their secondaries, but also keep track of their victory points
during the game when they are playing based on their selections.</p>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<p>As I am just starting I have mostly only used HTML and CSS with very minimal JavaScript. I aim to change this however and make it much more interactive 
the more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I learn along my way.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>My plans for this project include, as I stated in my description, to make it so that not only can you view and select your secondaries, but also keep 
track of the points during your games.</p>
